Hello! I am an oceanographer by training and a data scientist (AI specialist) by practice.
At the time of writing, my active interests and projects focus on plankton imagery, flow cytometry and the development of models suitable for these instruments.

# My Data Cult-ure Pledges

## **Reproducibility Pledges**

![I use github](https://img.shields.io/badge/I_use_github-FDAE00?style=flat&logo=github) 
  I will evidence my work in github

![Reproducibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/Reproducibility-03A9F4?style=flat&logo=github) 
  In my github I will provide any code used to make figures, a requirements.txt, dockerfile, renv.lock or similar, where applicable to my work



## **Software-specific Pledges**

![Excel is bad](https://img.shields.io/badge/Excel_is_bad.-8A2BE2?style=flat&logo=gitlfs) 
  I will not use Excel for data entry unless I am told to. Instead, I will use structured formats like CSV or JSON that force some data integrity.




## **Software-Agnostic Pledges**

![A table is 2D](https://img.shields.io/badge/A_table_is_2D-FDAE00?style=flat&logo=gitlfs) 
  I will not fudge a third dimension into something 2-dimensional

![App publication process](https://img.shields.io/badge/Application_publication_process-03A9F4?style=flat&logo=github) 
I will follow our [application publication process](https://cefas.sharepoint.com/sites/News/SitePages/Make-your-science-data-work-harder.aspx?web=1).

![Don't mix](https://img.shields.io/badge/No_Mixing_of_Coordinates-8BC34A?style=flat&logo=gitlfs)  
   I will not mix coordinate systems, such as degrees, minutes, and seconds with decimal degrees. I will not mix data formats (e.g., dates with numbers) within a single column or dataset.

![Don't nerf datasets](https://img.shields.io/badge/Include_Time_Zone_and_GPS-2196F3?style=flat&logo=gitlfs)  
I will always retain the time zone and GPS convention used as a data stamp. If my data involves spatial information, I will always include the relevant projection details.
