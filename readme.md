Hello! I am an oceanographer by training and a data scientist (AI specialist) by practice.
At the time of writing, my active interests and projects focus on plankton imagery, flow cytometry and the development of models suitable for these instruments.

### My pledges as a data scientist
![Excel is bad](https://img.shields.io/badge/Excel_is_bad-8A2BE2)  
Pledge to avoid using Excel for data entry. Instead, use formats like CSV or JSON to ensure data integrity and avoid cluttering Excel files with multiple tables in one sheet.
